    With this project, I managed to learn to look at how a developer would develop this application before starting, I did this project twice, the first time I was very frustrated because I had not planned how I would create each thing, manipulate each thing, make the site work, nothing, I just started coding and ended up deciding to redo the whole project, but the second time I already had a plan, how I would do each systems, how I would handle variables, states, everything...
